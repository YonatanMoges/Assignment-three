                It does matter to use relative sizing because when we use relative sizing, the HTML element will be sized relative to another element. On the other hand when we use absolute sizing the browser would not be able to resize because we use pixels to denote the sizes of the elements.

                    When our default browser is said to be 16px, it means whenever a paragraph is set to 1em, we are setting it to one unit of the default browser width. So when a person changes the value in the browser settings, that person is changing the size of everything relative to the browsers width.

                    Specific changes in css 3
                </p>
                <article>
                    1.	New selectors - In addition to the selectors that were available in CSS2, CSS 3 introduces some new selectors. Using these selectors you can choose DOM elements based on their attributes. So you don't need to specify classes and IDs for every element. Instead, you can utilize the attribute field to style them. <br>
                    2.	Rounded corners - Rounded corner elements can spruce up a website, but creating a rounded corner requires a designer to write a lot of code. Adjusting the height, width and positioning of these elements is a never-ending chore because any change in content can break them.
                        CSS 3 addresses this problem by introducing the border-radius property, which gives you the same rounded-corner effect and you don't have to write all the code. <br>
                    3.	Border image - Another exciting feature in CSS 3 is the ability to swap out a border with an image. The property border-image allows you to specify an image to display instead of a plain solid-colored border. <br>
                    4.	Box shadow - A box shadow allows you to create a drop shadow for an element. Usually this effect is achieved using a repeated image around the element. However, with the property box-shadow this can be achieved by writing a single line of CSS code. <br>
                    5.	Text shadow - The new text-shadow property allows you to add drop shadows to the text on a webpage. Prior to CSS 3, this would be done by either using an image or duplicating a text element and then positioning it. A similar property called box-shadow is also available in CSS 3. <br>
                    6.	CSS 3 Gradient - While the Gradient effect is a sleek Web design tool, it can be a drain on resources if not implemented correctly using current CSS techniques. Some designers use a complete image and put in the background for the gradient effect, which increases the page load time. <br>
                    7.	CSS 3 RGBA - While the Gradient effect is a sleek Web design tool, it can be a drain on resources if not implemented correctly using current CSS techniques. Some designers use a complete image and put in the background for the gradient effect, which increases the page load time. <br>
                    8.	CSS3 Transform - CSS 3 also introduced a property called transform, which enables rotating Web elements on a webpage. As of now, if a designer wants to rotate of an element, he or she uses JavaScript. Many JavaScript extensions/plugins are available online for this feature, but they can make the code cumbersome and most importantly consume more resources. <br>
                    9.	CSS 3 Multicolumn Layout - Almost every webpage today is divided into columns or boxes, and adjusting these boxes so they display correctly on different browsers takes a toll on Web designers. CSS 3 solves this problem with the multicolumn layout property; all you have to do is specify the number of columns you need and they will be created. <br>
                    10.	CSS 3 Web fonts - CSS 3 also facilitates embedding any custom font on a webpage. Fonts are dependent on the client system and Web pages can render only fonts that are supported by the browser or the client machine. By using the @font-face property, you can include the font from a remote location and can then use it. <br>
